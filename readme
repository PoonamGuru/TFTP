Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple,
File Transfer Protocol which allows a client to get from or put a file onto a remote host.
One of its primary uses is in the early stages of nodes booting from a local area network.
TFTP has been used for this application because it is very simple to implement.
This protocol doesn’t support advanced features that is there in FTP. User authentication, directory-listing features are not supported by this protocol. This implementation is done with simplicity and user friendliness as main focus.
TFTP was first standardized in 1981 and the current specification for the protocol can be found in RFC 1350
In this protocol three modes of transfer are currently supported: netascii (This is ascii as defined in “USA Standard Code for Information Interchange” with the modifications specified in “Telnet Protocol Specification” .) Note that it is 8 bit ascii. The term “netascii” will be used throughout this document to mean this particular version of ascii.); octet (This replaces the “binary” mode of previous versions of this document.) raw 8 bit bytes; mail, netascii characters sent to a user rather than a file. (The mail mode is obsolete and should not be implemented or used.) Additional modes can be defined by pairs of cooperating
